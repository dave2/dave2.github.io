## What happened this time?

Yep, I've gone and built yet another blog. This time I can't be 
bothered hosting it on my own magic domain so for now it's just
in GitHub Pages. 

## It's still Hugo?

Yes, still based on Hugo. I have a real love for static site 
generation even if it's sometimes a pain to work with. This time 
I've used some guide on using GH Actions to make this work, so I
can just `git push` and stuff happens.

I mean, it doesn't help the content quality but it sure is pretty.

## Content theme?

In the past I've tried to stick to a theme, like technology or 
whatever. I don't think I'll do that this time. It'll be whatever
I feel like rambling about with no good reason.

## This is not that

I have to put this here. These are my own views and not those of
anyone else or any other organisation I may be associated with in
any capacity blah blah.

It won't stop someone having a go of course.
