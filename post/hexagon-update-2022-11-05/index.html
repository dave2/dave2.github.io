Back then it looked like this:\nThe prefab itself is just a holder for a Sprite3D which was sized correctly to show as a border. It’s really just a PNG file with transparency. Anyway, I’d used it a fair bit, and even called it the “selector” prefab in the code. It had a script attached to do simple things like change the colour of the selector (by using the modulate property on the Sprite3D).\nBut I hadn’t actually used it for selection .. until now. Now it was definitely the shortest path to just showing what we could select as movement tiles. It was an already defined and built prefab, and because it was intended to be spawned only on tiles you could select, it made sense to just bake a collider into it as well.\nNow I had something I could spawn into the world which had both the visual indication to the player and the collider needed to make that space pickable. After that, it was a quick trip through the neighbours of the cell the player was on, and we’re off to the races.\nWhen we’re walking the neighbours for the current position, we need to test if we can move there. I had originally thought about baking a whole navigation mesh (probably actually just a filtered version of the one used to build roads?) but actually we can test the neighbours pretty fast against some simple policies.\nSo now every tile has player access policies called player_allowed:\n{ \"type\": \"grass\", \"prefab_file\": \"Tiles/hex_forest/hex_forest_detail.gltf.glb\", \"cost\": 1.0, \"road_cost\": 0.2, \"allow_rotation\": true, \"player_allowed\": \"always\" } The same was added to decorations:\n[ { \"type\": \"dock\", \"prefab_file\": \"TileDecorations/dock.glb\", \"tile_types\": [ \"water\" ], \"allow_rotation\": true, \"allow_roads\": true, \"show_roads\": true, \"player_allowed\": \"road_only\" } ] There are three policies: never which blocks player movement either by decoration or by base tile, road_only which requires a road defined on the base tile (either enforced by decoration, or by the tile itself), and always which is treated as a fall-through for decorations and a hard policy for tiles.\n(Aside: Yes, always on a decoration really means well_maybe but anyway..)\nAfter walking the neighbours and testing if we can use them, it’s straight into spawning some prefabs and managing them coming in and out of existance as we move.\nThe work handling clicks had already been done in testing out if I needed to modify all tile prefabs.\nSo we have player movement! It respects tile polices, so players can cross water if a boat path (internally just a road with a pretty tile) but not walk out on to any water. Mountains block you walking through them.\nI made a quick video (with no audio because it’s mostly disabled in game at the moment), which appears below:\nThe player icon is definitely very placeholder. I’m not sure what I want to do for that.\nThe last part, and made after the video was uploaded, was to finally clean up the placenames display. For a long time I’ve used an on-map Label3D which provided world-space text, and sort of tried to make it flat on the map just below the castle.\nWell cities are a lot more than just a single castle tile now, and the flat label looks quite bad against the selection hexes, so it was time to move them out of the world map and into the UI.\nThere’s now a banner at the top of the screen which shows the current placename (just cities for now). It fades in/out as you move in or out of a city. It’s much cleaner I think than the old map label.\nI think they’re a huge improvement, but will also allow me to name general areas, such as lake/ocean pieces, counties, or biomes. The UI stuff is very very slowly starting to feel like it does what I want it to do with only some tearing of hair out. Previously I would lose a lot of hair and have no UI to show for it!\nOf the goals for the next month, all but one of the movement ones are now done which is nice for only a couple of days later! Don’t expect that much progress in the rest of the month however!\n","wordCount":"763","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-11-05T22:43:00+13:00","dateModified":"2022-11-05T22:43:00+13:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://dave2.github.io/post/hexagon-update-2022-11-05/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Loosely Coherent Ramblings","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://dave2.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://dave2.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Loosely Coherent Ramblings (Alt + H)">Loosely Coherent Ramblings</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://dave2.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://dave2.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://dave2.github.io/post/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Hexagon Update: 5 Nov 2022</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-11-05 22:43:00 +1300 +1300'>November 5, 2022</span></div></header><div class=post-content><p>After much deliberation, I ended up doing none of the things I thought
